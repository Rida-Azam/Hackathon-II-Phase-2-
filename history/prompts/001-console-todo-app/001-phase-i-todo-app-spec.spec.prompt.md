## Prompt

# Phase I Specification – Evolution of Todo
In-Memory Python Console Todo Application

## 1. Overview
- **Project**: Evolution of Todo – Hackathon II
- **Phase**: Phase I
- **Objective**: Build a minimal, single-user, command-line Todo application that runs entirely in memory.
  The application must demonstrate all **Basic Level** features using pure Python standard library only.
- **Governing Documents**: Constitution.md (root)
- **Development Approach**: 100% spec-driven — all code must be generated by Claude Code based on this specification. No manual coding allowed.
- **Date**: December 30, 2025

## 2. Strict Phase I Constraints
- Single user only — no authentication, no user accounts
- In-memory storage only — no databases, no files, no persistence beyond runtime
- Pure Python 3.13+ standard library only — no external packages (no rich, click, typer, etc.)
- CLI (console) interface only — no web, no API, no GUI concepts
- Only Basic Level features are allowed — no intermediate or advanced features (no priorities, tags, due dates, recurring, search, sort, reminders, etc.)
- No references to future phases, technologies, or patterns
- Application must terminate cleanly on user request

## 3. Task Data Model
Each task is represented as a simple data structure with exactly these fields:
- id (int): Auto-incrementing, starts at 1, unique
- title (str): 1–200 characters after stripping whitespace (required)
- description (str): Max 1000 characters after stripping (optional, default "")
- completed (bool): Completion status (default False)

Storage: Use a single in-memory list; IDs are never reused after deletion.

## 4. CLI Interaction Flow (Menu-Based)
- Application starts with a welcome message
- Displays numbered menu
- User selects option by number
- After each action, redisplay menu
- Exit option must be available

## 5. User Stories & Features
1. Add Task - prompt for title (required) and description (optional)
2. View Task List - display all tasks with ID, title, status
3. Update Task - change title/description by ID
4. Delete Task - remove task by ID with confirmation
5. Mark Task Complete/Incomplete - toggle completion status

## 6. Error Cases & Validation
- Invalid menu choice → helpful error message
- Non-integer ID input → "Please enter a valid number."
- Task ID not found → "Task with ID [x] not found."
- Empty title → "Title is required."
- Description too long → "Description must be 1000 characters or less."

## Response snapshot

Created comprehensive feature specification for Phase I Console Todo Application:

**Branch**: `001-console-todo-app`
**Spec File**: `specs/001-console-todo-app/spec.md`

**User Stories (6 total)**:
- US1: Add New Task (P1)
- US2: View All Tasks (P1)
- US3: Mark Task Complete/Incomplete (P2)
- US4: Update Task (P3)
- US5: Delete Task (P3)
- US6: Application Navigation (P1)

**Functional Requirements**: 11 FRs covering all CRUD operations, validation, and navigation

**Key Entity**: Task (id, title, description, completed)

**Success Criteria**: 8 measurable outcomes focused on user experience and reliability

**Quality Checklist**: All items passed - spec is ready for `/sp.plan`

## Outcome

- Impact: Complete Phase I specification created with 6 user stories, 19 acceptance scenarios, 11 functional requirements
- Tests: N/A (specification artifact)
- Files: 2 files created (spec.md, checklists/requirements.md)
- Next prompts: /sp.plan to create implementation plan, or /sp.clarify if further refinement needed
- Reflection: Specification is comprehensive and aligns with Constitution constraints; no clarifications needed

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None - user input was detailed and complete
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): Spec Quality Checklist - PASS (all items)
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Standard specify flow with detailed user input
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): N/A - specification complete and validated
