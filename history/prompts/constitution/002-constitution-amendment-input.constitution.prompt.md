## Prompt

```text
# Constitution – Hackathon II: Evolution of Todo

## Project Name
Todo Application – Full Evolution from Console to Cloud-Native AI Chatbot

## Overall Project Goal
Build a progressively more sophisticated Todo application through five strictly phased, spec-driven stages, culminating in a cloud-native, event-driven, AI-powered distributed system.

## Core Constitution – Applies to All Phases

### 1. Spec-Driven Development as Mandatory
- No code may be written without approved specs and tasks
- All work must follow: Constitution → Specs → Plan → Tasks → Implement
- All implementation must be generated by Claude Code (or equivalent AI coding agent) based on explicitly written specifications.
- Humans may only: create folder structure,  technology matrix amendment)
- Approved: December 31, 2025
- Owner: [Your Name / GitHub Username]
- This document governs all AI agents working on this repository
```

## Response snapshot

Constitution already in place at `.specify/memory/constitution.md` (v1.0.0, ratified 2025-12-30). Input aligns with existing principles:
- Spec-Driven Development (Principle I)
- Phase governance framework
- Five-phase evolution structure confirmed

Templates verified compatible:
- plan-template.md: Constitution Check section aligned
- spec-template.md: Requirements section aligned
- tasks-template.md: Phase structure aligned

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Constitution framework established and verified
- 🧪 Tests: N/A
- 📁 Files: .specify/memory/constitution.md (v1.0.0)
- 🔁 Next prompts: /sp.spec to create feature specification for Phase I
- 🧠 Reflection: Constitution input aligns with existing v1.0.0. No amendment needed; content already covers Spec-Driven Development and phase governance requirements.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: "N/A"
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): "N/A"
- Prompt variant (if applicable): "N/A"
