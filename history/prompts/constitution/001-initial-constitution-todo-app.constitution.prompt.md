## Prompt

# Constitution – Hackathon II: Evolution of Todo

## Project Name
Todo Application – Full Evolution from Console to Cloud-Native AI Chatbot

## Overall Project Goal
Build a progressively more sophisticated Todo application through five strictly phased, spec-driven stages, culminating in a cloud-native, event-driven, AI-powered distributed system.

## Core Constitution – Todo Console App (Applies to All Phases)

### 1. Spec-Driven Development as Mandatory
- No code may be written without approved specs and tasks
- All work must follow: Constitution → Specs → Plan → Tasks → Implement
- All implementation must be generated by Claude Code (or equivalent AI coding agent) based on explicitly written specifications.
- Humans may only: create folder structure, write/edit specifications, refine specs, write constitutions, create CLAUDE.md files, run tests, commit code, and deploy.

### 2. Agent Behavior Rules
- No manual coding by humans (except trivial structural/setup files)
- No feature invention — agents may never add features not explicitly requested in the current phase's approved specification
- No deviation from approved specifications
- If output is incorrect/incomplete, refinement must occur at the specification level (update spec → regenerate), never by manually editing generated code

### 3. Phase Governance
- Each phase is strictly scoped by its own specification documents
- Future-phase features, patterns, libraries or architecture must never leak into earlier phases
- Architecture may evolve only through updated specifications and plans in later phases
- Backward compatibility between phases is not required — each phase may be built from scratch following its spec (but should reuse concepts where appropriate)

### 4. Technology Constraints
Phase I:
- Python 3.13+
- UV for package management
- In-memory storage only (no database)
- CLI interface only (no GUI)
- No external libraries (pure standard library Python)

Later phases (for reference only – not active in Phase I):
- Phase II: Next.js 16+ (App Router), FastAPI, SQLModel, Neon Serverless PostgreSQL, Better Auth (JWT)
- Phase III: OpenAI ChatKit, OpenAI Agents SDK, Official MCP SDK
- Phase IV: Docker, Minikube, Helm Charts, kubectl-ai, kagent
- Phase V: Kafka (Redpanda), Dapr, DigitalOcean Kubernetes (DOKS) or GKE/AKS, GitHub Actions CI/CD

### 5. Quality Principles
- Clean architecture and single-responsibility principle
- Clear separation of concerns (UI / business logic / data access)
- Stateless services where required (especially Phase III+)
- Defensive programming, strong input validation, friendly & clear error messages
- Comprehensive docstrings and comments in generated code
- Readable console UX (Phase I), responsive web UI (Phase II+), natural-language friendly chatbot (Phase III+)

## Phase I Specific Scope – In-Memory Python Console App
This phase is strictly limited to the following scope. No other features are permitted.

Tasks must cover:
1. Task data model and in-memory storage
2. CLI menu and application loop
3. Add task functionality
4. View task list functionality
5. Update task functionality
6. Delete task functionality
7. Mark task complete/incomplete
8. Input validation and error handling
9. Application startup and exit flow

## Phase I Rules
- Tasks must be small, testable, and sequential
- Do NOT introduce new features
- Do NOT include future phases
- Tasks must be sufficient to fully implement Phase I
- Task model must include:
  - auto-incrementing integer ID (starting from 1)
  - title (required, string, 1–200 characters)
  - description (optional, string, ≤1000 characters)
  - completed (boolean, default False)
- Console interface: simple numbered menu or command-based (e.g. "add", "list", "update 3 new title", "delete 5", "complete 2", "quit")
- All user inputs must be validated with helpful feedback

## Approval & Version
- Version: 1.1 (Updated with full constitution block – December 30, 2025)
- Approved: December 30, 2025
- Owner: [Your Name / GitHub Username]
- This document governs all AI agents working on this repository

## Response snapshot

Created initial constitution v1.0.0 for Todo Application at `.specify/memory/constitution.md` with:

**5 Core Principles:**
1. Spec-Driven Development (MANDATORY) - Constitution → Specs → Plan → Tasks → Implement workflow
2. Agent Behavior Rules (NON-NEGOTIABLE) - No manual coding, no feature invention, no spec deviation
3. Phase Governance - Strict phase isolation, no future-phase leakage
4. Technology Constraints - Phase I: Python 3.13+, UV, in-memory, CLI, stdlib only
5. Quality Principles - Clean architecture, SRP, defensive programming, comprehensive docs

**Additional Sections:**
- Phase I Specific Scope (9 required task areas)
- Task Model Specification (id, title, description, completed)
- Phase I Rules (implementation constraints)
- Governance (amendment process, compliance requirements)

**Templates Verified:** plan-template.md, spec-template.md, tasks-template.md, phr-template.prompt.md - all compatible.

## Outcome

- Impact: Initial constitution established for 5-phase Todo Application evolution project
- Tests: N/A (documentation artifact)
- Files: 1 file created/updated (.specify/memory/constitution.md)
- Next prompts: /sp.specify to create Phase I feature specification
- Reflection: Successfully transformed user's detailed constitution requirements into structured, template-compliant constitution document

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A (documentation task)
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Standard constitution creation flow
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Monitor if Constitution Check in plan-template.md correctly references new principles
